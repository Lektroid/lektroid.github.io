            LEK Productions offers a number of services from music production to sound design. Dedicated to the underground dance movement, LEK Productions also offers services such as music for the film and game industries as well as sound design.

            LEK Productions is the brainchild of Richard Elliott. A long time producer who has been involved in the music industry since the Summer of Love '89, initially playing his music in clubs and outdoor events around South-East England, it all took off for him in 1992, where his early releases reached UK national chart status. Over the decades that followed he has been involved in many projects in the electronic music industry with many notable successes.<br><br>

            Richard has since played in many countries around the world. However, during the lockdowns of 2020/'21, Richard was forced to stop his musical expeditions and decided to put the time to good use and turned to education, with the goal of obtaining an honours degree in music technology. He is currently studying hard at university in the hope that it will soon pay off when he returns to the industry.

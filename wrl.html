    <div class="mx-auto mx-4 max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    Hi, My name is Richard Elliott and this is my presentation for the work based learning module.<br><br>

    Due to the situation following the lockdowns of 2020, the university was unable to provide all students with a placement. As time marched on getting closer to the start date I was getting concerned that I would not have the opportunity to undertake a work-based learning project. As the start of the project drew closer, my anxiety levels were high, not knowing whether I would be forced onto the alternative module, Immersive Audio, which is highly academic, and since I’m a hands-on type of person, naturally I would fare much better taking the practical option of a work based module.<br><br>

    With this in mind, I had no option but to reach out to various studios to see if they would be willing to take me on for this project. I managed to gain the interest of a local studio who deals in theatre sound and lighting and also has an AV studio within my local library at West Kilbride. Following a verbal confirmation, the premises was needed to be looked at and checked over for health and safety by the module coordinator. On top of that, the studio owner had projects to undertake on the other side of the country. This delayed the start of my project by several weeks.<br><br>

    The PID was also required within 3 weeks of the start of the project. However, I couldn’t start my project until after 3 weeks in, which meant I had absolutely no work to base it on. Therefore, I could not complete the PID as I would have liked to.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 2: ARK Company Background</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    The company who was willing to take me on for this project was ARK Consultancy, which I was introduced to via a charity called the three towns men’s shed who I volunteer with on a weekly basis.<br><br>

    Ark Consultancy is a company formed by Drew Kirkland. Drew initially started work doing discos whilst at school in 1979 age 15 (called Images). Following this, Drew started up with the Enterprise Allowance Scheme as a professional event DJ. He was later offered a job installing speakers for a local hotel. This kickstarted the installation business which he called ARK which he ran through the 1990s. <br><br>

    Drew wrote the manual for the ISO9002 standard for Welco Engineering in 1998, which he later directed. This conveyed towards the professionalism in Drew’s repertoire, in which he formed a company called One 2 Company Ltd. Which specialised in designing nightclubs, which involved everything from designing DJ booths to full DMX lighting systems, as well as being a main dealer for Function-One professional systems, and also maintaining work as a DJ.<br><br>

    After leaving One 2 Company, Drew started ARK Productions in 2010, which was funded by a credit card. This transpired to Drew becoming the main ShowCAD lighting engineer in Scotland. ARK Productions is now responsible for installations in St Andrews Younger Hall, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, and Kings Theatre through Solotech, amongst many other large scale contracts. Currently ARK Productions is undertaking projects using DANTE, Q-Sys, and Extron to name a few.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 3: Planning & Organisation</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    For this project I was required to take field recordings and create a surround soundscape of water effects for use in theatre. We went out on location to Glenburn Waterfall, North Ayrshire.<br><br>
   
    First we decided on the project and agreed on a 3D soundscape of a waterfall and the river coming away from it. Then we had to decide on a location, which had to be accessible and safe in order to take a lot of recording equipment. We decided on Glenburn Waterfall since it is local, and close to the parking position. There is safe access, which is located within a small gorge, which has an atmospheric audio quality. There are also several nesting birds which gave a very dynamic impression of the landscape.<br><br>

    It was important to have accessibility behind the waterfall as well as the small rapids running away from the waterfall for total immersivity. <br><br>

    Ambisonic recording front and rear of waterfall. The rear of the waterfall has a cave which results in natural reverberation, this would be advantageous. Recording water disturbance with the hydrophones, placed near and far from the waterfall, using shotgun microphones to enhance sense of detail in specific targeted locations. Mid-side microphones were used to give a wider audio image.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 4: Studio Work</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    I had several roles to achieve this goal, After the recording was completed, my first job was to upgrade the Apple computer systems in the studio, this involved replacing hardware inside the machines, firstly upgrading the SSDs, once these were installed, it turned out in order to upgrade the OS, metal-enabled GPU’s were required, which was required to process surround sound audio. This paved the way to make the project possible.<br><br>

    Once the computer systems were up to spec, we needed to take field recordings. We went out to a nearby waterfall. We used equipment from the studio including hydrophones, as well as some of my own recording equipment. I had never had experience using hydrophones, so this was a great learning experience. The first day we went out we discovered there was some wind noise which entered the microphones thus spoiling the recordings. Therefore, we needed to go out a second time and re-record the content.<br><br>
----><br><br>
    Logic was primarily used for the editing as it was the software I was most familiar with in the studio. I pulled in the audio clips into the arrange page, I could then see each of the takes as waveforms which I was able to zoom into and edit. This also allowed the use of plugins which could enhance and correct any frequency imbalance in the recordings.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 5: Communication</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    I attended meetings within the company, this gave me an insight into how to conduct myself positively and professionally as well as giving me the confidence to put across constructive points in order to enhance the outcome of the project. Meetings were undertaken both online and in person. Online meeting etiquette was quite different from meeting face to face. For example, if you are in a face-to-face meeting with 6 people, you can confer with the person sat next to you in order to check the validity of an idea before presenting it within the main meeting. This is not possible with an online meeting. <br><br>

    During the meetings, Drew and I had lengthy discussions about safety considerations, expected weather, transport and access requirements, as well as discussing safe water levels due to rainfall or other weather conditions. We also discussed an exit strategy if anything was to go wrong. Leaving notification with third party should communication drop off whilst in remote locations. For safety reasons we agreed to never work alone and always be in sight of each other whilst on location.<br><br>

    Also, during my time in the studio, several clients were in, taking part in various projects. I was involved in technical discussions in various group meetings. This was an insight into how to conduct myself in a professional environment.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 6: Professional Development</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    New transferable skills haven been advantageous to my professional profile, in regards to be able to offer new services to potential clients with more in-depth knowledge using professional equipment, which has widened my horizons in the industry.<br><br>

    My awareness of the business financially is something I had never considered prior to this project, but after several meetings, and listening to the discussions I have a much better understanding of the importance of the financial side of the industry. <br><br>

    A working example usually means a client would go to a consultancy company, which then goes out to tender (several companies are contacted by the consultancy company to get the best service to price ratio). It is the job of ARK to meet the design work necessary to obtain and fulfil the contracts, usually in project management role.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 7: Future Career</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    Having had a glimpse into another aspect of the industry has provided new opportunities, and I plan to continue working for ARK on a voluntary basis, with the possibility of freelance work, as this will be beneficial in the industry.<br><br>

    The areas I have been looking at is music and audio within art (this could involve ambisonic multi point recording, mood uplifting soundscapes and audio for meditation, mental health and sounds of nature). Sound design for video games, this can include anything from simple foley and effects to full compositions.

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-8 my-2 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl text-red-600">Slide 8: Quality & Professionalism</h2>

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-2 px-8">
    Having worked to industry standards, not only from a safety aspect but the equipment and software used also. I now have a much better understanding of the formats used in the industry, correct levels expected for various formats, for both commercial and domestic use.<br><br>

    All in all, this placement has gone extremely well and I’ve enjoyed every moment of my time there.<br><br>

    Does anyone have any questions?

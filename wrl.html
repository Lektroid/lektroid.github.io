    Hello, my name is Pamela Dunlop. This is my presentation for the third-year work related learning module. On my first slide are some of my loves that not only shaped my degree choice but influenced my placement. At the bottom, are my pet kittens, Sausage and Beans and my Hermann’s tortoise, Cheeseburger.

   My zoology degree focusses on animals primarily so, the SULSA graduate masterclasses I undertook as my placement was a chance to explore the business side of science. The first masterclass was Glasgow Caledonia, the 2nd at UWS Lanarkshire and the 3rd at Glasgow university.

   Over the 3 masterclasses I completed a variety of group tasks from a range of companies including, Lentitek whom specialise in gene modified cell therapies for lentiviruses such as, HIV, Antibody Analytics who design and develop bespoke bioassays or offer routine analysis on established assay platforms, BioAscent, a leading provider of integrated drug discovery services and Charles River, a contract research organisation who supported the development of 85% of the drugs approved by the FDA in 2019.<br><br>
    Tasks at GCU from Lentitek was to find a way market a product effectively so that it could be established properly in the market by using a 9-point scoring system. We chose smart glasses that would hopefully enable patients with visual impairments and neurological problems to communicate through eye movements to smart devices from the glasses.<br><br>
    Next, this task consisted of determining the effectiveness of a client’s new antibody- based cancer therapy. A plan was drafted with all departments required and their roles. These were some of the questions asked to make sure all parameters could be met efficiently and safely.<br><br>
    Tasks at UWS involved taking on the role of a Quality Assurance auditor by making sure files were completed correctly to ALCOA principles which are that data should be Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, and Accurate. In addition, 'ALCOA+' guidance recommends that data is also Complete, Consistent, Enduring, and Available. This was a document that had to be audited and would have failed inspection due the lack of AD after the date and the note of AM/PM after the time.<br><br>
    Lastly a task at Glasgow was from a leading stem cell research company called, Reprocell. This was to develop a Customer Value Proposition (CVP) which is a tool used in sales and marketing to communicate to clients exactly what they will be buying into. Our group proposed to Reprocell that we could provide them with a direct hospital to lab tissue delivery via drone.

    Following the masterclasses, I was to carry out a systematic search for a UWS researcher. The question posed was, how do grey squirrels affect red squirrels in
Europe? I had to learn how to use various databases including the one shown, Web of Science. I was given specific keywords to help my search including disease, squirrelpox and extirpation. These were then split into stages and searched individually. As shown on the slide my initial result was an unmanageable 38million articles. I chose to only search for the grey squirrel, red squirrel and squirrel pox as the articles needed to at least have those. I then refined to articles written in English and published since 2016.This produced 23 articles. In total along with my searches on other databases, I had a total of 76 references that were suitable. These were then passed onto the researcher.

   Reflecting on my placement, I have learned that there is whole new side to science I had never experienced before. Finding out how scientists can work within the industry not just based in the lab but learn about industry processes from product conception, development through to product marketing and launch. I found myself really interested in the Quality Assurance auditing aspect, with thoughts on that being a potential career. Networking with other students from different universities, who were mostly in their honours and master’s years and being able to contribute effectively to tasks I wouldn’t usually undertake was a fantastic confidence boost.

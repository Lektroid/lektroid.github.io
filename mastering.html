    <h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-2 font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-red-600">What I Offer</h2>

    <div class="mx-3 md:mx-6">          
        At Lek Productions, I’ve had the privilege of working with a broad spectrum of clients, from high-profile artists and industry veterans to emerging labels. My goal is simple: to bring out the best in every track, no matter your experience level. Whether you're a well-known name in the industry or just beginning your journey, I aim to elevate your music to its fullest potential.
        <br><br>
        With over 30 years of professional experience in the music industry, I’ve collaborated with many artists, labels, and projects across multiple genres. My work has been featured on labels like Street Sounds, Hero Records, and Back to the Oldskool. Over the years, I’ve built lasting relationships with clients and a reputation for delivering high-quality, tailored sound.
        <br><br>
        Every project, regardless of the artist or label’s size, receives the same care and attention to detail, ensuring that your unique vision is fully realized in the final master.

    <h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-2 font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-red-600">The Final Touch That Makes Your Music Shine...</h2>

    <div class="mx-3 md:mx-6">   
        Mastering is one of the most critical stages of the music production process. It's the final step that transforms your creative work into a polished, professional sound ensuring it shines on any platform, from streaming services to high-end sound systems. Often misunderstood as a quick fix for a bad mix, the true purpose of mastering is to enhance an already solid mix, adding the final touches that elevate it to its fullest potential - bringing out excitement, clarity, detail, openness, and balance, all ready for distribution.
        <br><br>
        As the last step before your music reaches the listener’s ears, mastering ensures your track sounds incredible on every system, whether it’s played through a phone speaker, a high-end stereo, or a major event sound system. I take this responsibility seriously, treating every track with the respect it deserves. I work closely with my clients, always considering their creative vision, while delivering exceptional results with precision and care.
        <br><br>
        My degree-level mastering service is bespoke, tailored to your specific needs. Each project is approached individually, ensuring that I meet the highest standards for both digital and vinyl formats. I take pride in making sure you're 100% satisfied with the final result.
        <br><br>
        From ensuring consistency across albums or EPs to spectral balancing, stereo field enhancement, and industry-standard loudness, I use multi-stage processing to maximize the impact of your music. My goal is always to ensure that all my work meets the highest industry standards for clarity, balance, and consistency. While I work quickly, I never compromise on quality. Every track is treated with the attention and expertise it deserves, resulting in a master that truly reflects your artistic vision.

    <h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-2 font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-red-600">Why Choose a Professional Mastering Engineer?</h2>

    <div class="mx-3 md:mx-6">
        While there are many tools available today that claim to “master” your music, it's important to remember that true mastering requires expertise and experience. Generic, automated services or DIY solutions often lack the attention to detail needed to make your track sound its best on all platforms. I bring years of knowledge and a trained ear to ensure your music not only sounds great but also translates well across different systems—whether that's streaming, vinyl, or high-end audio setups.
        <br><br>
        At LEK Productions, I offer a personalised service focused on quality, clear communication, and tailored to your artistic vision. With expertise and precision, I ensure your music is ready for the next level of distribution.

    <h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-2 font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-red-600">How to submit your music</h2>

    <div class="mx-3 md:mx-6">
        Please provide clean unmastered copies of your mixdowns, ie. no plugins on the master bus.<br>
        <br>
        A text file with the following:<br>
    <ul class="text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>Song Title(s)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Artist Name</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Genre</strong></li>
    </ul>

<p>Also, if you could provide any of the following:</p>

    <ul class="text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>BPM</strong></li>
        <li><strong>ISRC codes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Artwork</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Remixer, publisher, or any other relevant info</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    
        Output levels should not exceed -0.3dB throughout the mix (Audible peaks will not be magically hidden by the mastering process). This will allow enough headroom to deliver outstanding results. 
        <br><br>
        In preparation for submitting your mixdown, please ensure that all channels not requiring sub frequencies (such as lead riffs, hi-hats, snares, etc.) have either a low cut filter applied or the low shelf reduced. This will help eliminate any unnecessary bass frequencies, preventing muddiness in the low end and providing additional headroom for optimal loudness and punch in the final mix.
        <br><br>
        I can work with any bitrate and sample depth. While sample rate conversion is possible, to avoid potential aliasing during the process and to ensure optimal quality, we typically deliver the file in its original format unless otherwise requested.
        <br><br>
        When you’re ready to submit your pre-masters, get in touch via our <a href="/contact" class="link"><b>contact form</b></a> and I’ll provide details on the next steps, including using WeTransfer and any additional information required.

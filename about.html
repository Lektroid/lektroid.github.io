            LEK Productions is the brainchild of Richard Elliott. A long time producer who has been involved in the music industry since the Summer of Love '89, initially playing his music in clubs and outdoor events around South-East England, it all took off for him in 1992, where his early releases reached UK national chart status. Over the decades that followed he has been involved in many projects in the electronic music industry with many notable successes.<br><br>

            Richard has since played in many countries around the world. However, during the lockdowns of 2020/'21, Richard was forced to stop his musical expeditions and thus decided to put his time to good use and turned to education, he has gained a degree in music technology, and is now undertaking his honours year, in which he will graduate in 2024. Alongside his education, Richard is steadily making his way back into the industry with new record deals and live performances.

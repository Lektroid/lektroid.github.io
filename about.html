    <p>Richard Elliott, BSc, is a veteran electronic music producer, mastering engineer, and founder of LEK Productions. His career spans four decades, multiple aliases, and international performances, blending a deep technical understanding of music technology with a lifelong passion for underground electronic culture.</p>

    <h2>Early Musical Foundations</h2>

    <p>Richard’s journey began long before the rave era of the 1990s. Raised in a household where classical music met electric guitar-driven rock, he learned to appreciate both the structure and the experimentation in music. From a young age, he taught himself piano, rearranging classical pieces like Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata and experimenting with chord progressions, arpeggios, and harmonic textures.</p>

    <p>By the mid-1980s, he discovered the burgeoning Electro scene, absorbing the raw energy of Street Sounds compilations and tracks like Cybotron’s Techno City. Encounters with local breakdance crews and street performances sparked a fascination with rhythm, electronic instrumentation, and the creative potential of emerging music technologies.</p>

    <h2>DIY Electronics and Early Production</h2>

    <p>From the age of nine, Richard built electronic projects, developing a practical understanding of circuits, oscillators, and sound design. By his early teens, he was creating custom mixers, experimenting with synthesizers, and mastering early digital tools, including the Commodore 64 and Amiga computers. These formative experiences combined technical ingenuity with musical creativity, laying the foundation for his distinctive production approach.</p>

    <h2>Professional Career and Collaborations</h2>

    <p>Richard released music under aliases such as Lektroid, Brainstormer, and Wise Ones. He collaborated with influential labels including Formation Records, Whitehouse Records, Ozone Recordings, Dominance Electricity, Street Sounds, Binalog, and Elektrodos. His work has been performed internationally in Thailand, Spain, Italy, and the UK, bridging the gap between underground club culture and professional production standards.</p>

    <p>Early collaborative projects, such as Brainstorm Crew and Digital Kaos, allowed him to experiment with new sounds, sampling techniques, and live performance setups. He became adept at taking tracks from home recordings to fully produced vinyl releases, learning the complete workflow of recording, mixing, mastering, and distribution.</p>

    <h2>Academic and Professional Expertise</h2>

    <p>In addition to decades of hands-on experience, Richard holds a BSc in Music Technology. This formal training complements his practical skills, ensuring that every project he masters combines technical precision with creative depth. LEK Productions today offers professional mastering, production guidance, and sound design expertise, catering to both emerging and established artists worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Legacy and Philosophy</h2>

    <p>Richard’s approach is defined by curiosity, problem-solving, and the pursuit of sonic excellence. From early home studios to international stages, he has consistently blended technical mastery with artistic vision. LEK Productions represents not just a studio, but a philosophy: empowering artists to reach their full creative potential while preserving the authenticity and energy of the underground scene.</p><br>

            LEK Productions is the brainchild of Richard Elliott. A long time producer who has been involved in the music industry since the Summer of Love '89, initially playing his music in clubs and outdoor events around South-East England, it all took off for him in 1992, where his early releases reached UK national chart status. Over the decades that followed he has been involved in numerous projects in the electronic music industry with many notable successes, he has also played in many countries around the world.<br><br>

            During the lockdowns of 2020, Richard was forced to stop his musical expeditions and instead, put his time to good use by gaining a degree in Music Technology. Combined with decades of experience in this field, he has honed his skills as a full-time professional mastering engineer, whilst continuining to produce music for the industry.

            Active since early 80s as producer and DJ, Richard Elliott has released music under the Energy Principle, Brainstormer, Logical Breaks, Brainstorm Crew, Sola, Solaris, Wise Ones, LektroiD monikers and under his own name. I had the chance to check some of his tracks as Lektroid on the Binalog Productions and Dominance Electricity compilations I reviewed as well as on a couple I purchased ("Nu Electro" volume 2 and 3).<br><br>

            RIchard started to play as a self taught pianist at age 11 and has been producing his own breakbeat, ambient and electro since the 1980s, starting on his trusted Commodore 64 and analogue hardware. First getting his music played in a club called 'Tekno Dreem' in Peterborough, UK back in 1989, soon after he teamed up with various other artists as a producer, forming groups such as Digital Kaos, Mysticism and the better known Brainstorm Crew. After leaving the Brainstorm Crew, Richard teamed back up with the other member of Digital Kaos for another release, which was also on F-Project.<br><br>

            After producing and remixing for several other dance-floor related genres through the '90s, Richard had further involvement in the breakbeat scene under the moniker Brainstormer. After that, he started to produce music under the LektroiD moniker and released tracks for Street Sounds, Binalog Productions, and Dominance Electricity. He started his own label Lek Productions and released four single and two albums since. <br><br>

            The latest one, is titled "Quantum Theory" and contains fifteen new tracks which are in balance from 80s electro, 90s techno, space atmospheres, a little bit of acid (on "Synthone 1000") and breakbeat (the closing "Bar Groove"). LektroiD's sound is powerful and rich thanks to Richard's decades experience and also thanks to the fact that he builds some of his machines, giving in this way, a personal touch to the lot. Mixing 808 and 909 drum sounds with bleeping dry sounds, warm pads and a bit of filtered vocals, LektroiD's music tend to be upbeat and dancey but without forgetting the importance of melody and a complex rhythmical texture. Check for example "Macrocosm": it sounds like an early 80s electro version of Jean Michael Jarre with catchy synth phrases.

    LEK Productions offers degree-level audio services with over 30 years experience in the industry, such as audio mastering for both digital and vinyl, composition, content creation and sound design for the movie and gaming industries, as well as soundbank and patch creation for both software and hardware synthesizers. <br></br>

<h2 class="mx-4 md:mx-2 font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-orange-600">Mastering</h2>

    <div class="mx-3 md:mx-6">
    Mastering is the main service we offer, as it is possibly the most vital process of all; it allows the music you’ve put all your creative efforts into to sound great on all platforms and systems. This vital step is often misunderstood as being one that enhances the sound and makes your mix loud and polished like the competition. Although these are just byproducts of the corrective methods used to finalise your mix.
    <br><br>
    While we at LEK Productions prefer to concentrate on the positives, we feel it is important to let our potential customers know that there are a large number of cowboys in the industry, who download a few free plugins, fire up the presets they like the name of, then put themselves out there as mastering engineers, undercutting the professionals to make a fast buck, while potentially causing irreversible damage to your music by means of over saturating the compressor or pushing the loudness way beyond any platform can handle. While it might often sound ‘better’ playing on your machine (louder is always better, right?), often don’t have the indepth knowledge required to analyse and processes the mix to keep the dynamics strong, pull instruments into the wide stereo field whilst retaining punch, and make it work on every platform, including vinyl. A bad master would be akin to spending 5 grand on a camera then fitting a cheap plastic lens filter on the front.
    <br><br>
    Mastering is the final touch on your music before it reaches the listeners ear. We take every aspect of mastering very seriously and treat every track respectfully, working closely with our clients, taking into consideration creative choices with the highest regard for exemplary results. Our degree-level mastering is always tailored to your requirements, working on each project individually to the highest standards for both digital and vinyl until you are 100% satisfied with the end result. 
    <br><br>
    Definitive alignment for Album/EP consistency, corrective balance adjustment, mid-side equalisation to open the stereo field, then leveling the end result for industry level maximisation whilst retaining essentaial dynamics, using multi-stage processing to bring you the most impact for your productions to stand head and shoulders above the competition. We work hard to maintain fast turnaround times without compromising on quality.
